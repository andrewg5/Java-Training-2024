a) you never create an instance of the pokemon class, as you only create children of it.
b) All pokemon have some of the same functions, this means that if you put the methods in a parent class, you would not have to write the same method in every pokemon.
c) an example is the default constructor and the constructor that takes the name and the health.
d) an example would be creating pokemon but setting them as the children
e) I made the getters public so that you can access the values from a different file.
f) I made the name private because you dont have to change it and it would clean up the code.
